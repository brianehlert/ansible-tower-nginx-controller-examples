Handling Certificates

This demonstration stores the certificate artifacts in a git repository.
With one pull the project downloads the certificates and a set of helper functions.
The file that needs to be updated is the vars.yaml to refer to the correct certificate artifacts.
The rest of the framework playbook should remain the same.
